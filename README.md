# Build My Own HTTP Server

## Overview

In this project, I am building my own HTTP server to learn about TCP servers, the HTTP protocol, and more. This challenge allows me to dive into the core aspects of web server functionality, including handling simple GET/POST requests, serving files, and managing multiple concurrent connections.

## Project Goals

- Understand the basics of TCP connections.
- Learn how HTTP headers and verbs work.
- Implement a server capable of handling multiple connections simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To start building my HTTP server, I will follow the instructions and utilize the resources provided.

## Key Learning Points

1. **TCP Connections**: Gain an understanding of how TCP connections are established and maintained.
2. **HTTP Protocol**: Learn the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol, including request and response structures.
3. **HTTP Verbs**: Implement handling for various HTTP verbs such as GET and POST.
4. **Concurrency**: Develop techniques to handle multiple connections concurrently, ensuring efficient server performance.
5. **File Serving**: Enable the server to serve files to clients.


## Progress

Throughout the project, I will be continuously testing and refining my server to ensure it meets all the specified requirements and handles requests efficiently.
